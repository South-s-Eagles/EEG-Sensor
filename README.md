EEG. Literally, electro-encephalo-graphy, is a device that can record the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp **_(head skin)._**

### Why is it important?

Measuring electrical activity from the brain is useful because it reflects how the many different neurons in the brain network communicate with each other via electrical impulses.

Also, we can help people with mental diseases.

Furthermore its possible to track the brain activity on a lot of scenarios, like tests, doing sex, seeing your ex photograph.

### Advantages

- it can directly measure the brain activity
  - Our brain is constantly active, generating electrical activity which is very subtle _significantly less than a 9V battery,_ but it can be capture using the right device,
- Neuroscientific research has been obtaining consistent findings and established well-accepted theories on how the EEG signals relate to cognitive, affective or attentional processing
- EEG is inexpensive, lightweight, and portable
  - As you can see on the picture above, it can be portable, and you do not have to be on a hospital to wear a eeg, and get information about your brain activity.
